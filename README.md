# Welcome to my Travel Journal!

My Travel Journal is a place where I can log all the noteworthy places I've visited and want to reflect on.

It was created using React, where I am able to dymically add content and styles. I'm also able to take advantage of building reusable components so I can easily create consistent UI components fast.

This project is currently being built out. If you'd like to see my progress notes, I've created a [Project Wiki](https://github.com/caseyocampo/travel-journal/wiki) that you can visit. It's mostly a place where I note and keep track of what needs to get done.

## This project was created with Create React App
